## The Why & The Hackathon
Shoutout to Boot.dev (2025 Hackathon) for their amazing opportunity to program ANYTHING and truly get your passion/capstone project ideas into a fully developed program!

I built Tempest as a hands-on project to work on my skills in Web Development and displaying/fetching real-time information from APIs. Not to mention, this is one of my first ever experience with Hackathons & GitHub!

My goal was to provide a clean and easy-to-read website for people who want to find out what the weather is like in specific locations instantly. While doing so, I made sure to incorporate essential information (which can be found in the features section) and clipart images to display the weather conditions thanks to OpenWeather!

Again, thank you Boot.dev for this opportunity. Even as a beginner with this simple project, I thought that the whole experience taught me a lot and prepared me for future projects that I have yet to embark on!

(p.s. loving the other Boot.dev Hackathon projects!!)
