## The Why & The Hackathon
Shoutout to Boot.dev (2025 Hackathon) for their amazing opportunity to program ANYTHING and truly get your passion/capstone project ideas into a fully developed program!

I built Tempest as a hands-on project to work on my skills in Web Development and displaying/fetching real-time information from APIs. Not to mention, this is one of my first ever experience with Hackathons & GitHub!

My goal was to provide a clean and easy-to-read website for people who want to find out what the weather is like in specific locations instantly. While doing so, I made sure to incorporate essential information (which can be found in the features section) and clipart images to display the weather conditions thanks to OpenWeather!
